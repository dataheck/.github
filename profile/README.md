DataHeck is my freelance business that builds data infrastructure, primarily for clients that are currently using a manual spreadsheet-based process.

The following is my elevator pitch.

# Data Management Should Serve YOU

Do you manually collect, record, or cross-reference data as part of your business process? Are a few Excel spreadsheets duct-taped between separate enterprise systems your data management system? Are you competing in the 21st century but still using tools from the 20th?

Does your data serve your business process, or does your business process serve your data?

Data should be automatically collected, recorded, cross-referenced, and reported on. Your team should be free from punching numbers into spreadsheets; they should be using their expertise to act on that information. Thatâ€™s where your advantage is; my advantage is in getting you there.

Spreadsheets are fantastic tools, but they do not scale with your business. The data exploration and visualization available in them is extremely limited and time-consuming. They are not data science ready. They are not 21st century ready.
